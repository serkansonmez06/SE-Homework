			<h3> About me! </h3>
			<P>I'm originally from Turkey. I have been in the United StateÂ for over 10 years. I have Economics (in Turkey) and MBA (in The USA) Degrees. Right after covid-19 started, I have watched youtube videos about Java and purchased online courses. I finished 20% or 25% of the courses. I have a very basic knowledge of programming. I accidentally discovered PerScholas online when I was looking for a job and new opportunities. I'm so excited to be part of this program. I'm sure, this course will bring me new opportunities.</P>
